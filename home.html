    <h2>Whiplash Curves</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The whiplash or whiplash line is a decorative art and design motif that rose to popularity during the Art Nouveau period. The whiplash is assymetrical and sinuous, often appearing in the form of an ornamental s-curve. Curving whiplash lines, modelled after natural vegetal forms, were frequently interlaced and combined with twists and scrolls to inspire a poetic and romantic association. In architecture, furniture and other decorative arts, the decoration was entirely integrated with the structure. The whiplash line appeared frequently in furniture design, railings and other ornamental iron work, floor tiles, posters and jewelry. It became so common that critics of Art Nouveau ridiculed it as "the noodle style". Noted designers who used the whiplash camera inclued Henry van de Velde, Aubrey Beardsley, Hector Guimard, Alphonse Mucha, and Victor Horta.</p>

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The style took its name from a woven fabric panel, called "Coup de Fouet" (1895) or "whiplash," by the German artist Hermann Obrist which depicted the stems and roots of the cyclamen flower. The twisting and curving lines of the whiplash form have a long history. They are similar to the arabesque design, used particularly in Islamic art, such as the ceramic tiles of the mosque of Samarkand in Central Asia, They featured prominently in the lavish decoration of the rocaille or rococo style in the early 18th century. They were found in the Japanese prints of Katsushika Hokusai, which became popular in France just as the Art Nouveau movement was beginning, and which particularly inspired the paintings of flowers by Vincent van Gogh, such as The Irises (1890). In her article, "Art Nouveau, Art of Darkness: African Lineages of Belgian Modernism, Part I," scholar Debora L. Silverman identifies Belgian art nouveau as a specifically Congo style and as “imperial modernism,” created from Congo raw materials and inspired by Congo motifs—the lash, the vine, and the elephantine.</p>
